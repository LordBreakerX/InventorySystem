# Adding the Inventory System to Your Unity Project

You can integrate the Inventory system into your Unity project by either importing it as a Unity package or by downloading the full project as a ZIP file. The method you choose depends on how you want to access and use the Inventory system (with or without demo content).

## Option 1: Importing the Unity Package

1. In this repository, navigate to the `UnityPackages` folder.
2. Choose one of the following packages:
   - `Inventory`: Contains only the core day-night system.
   - `Inventory_WithDemo`: Includes the core system along with a demo scene.
3. Click on your preferred package, then click the three dots (`...`) on the right side.
4. Select **Download** from the dropdown menu.
5. Open your Unity project.
6. In the **Project** window, right-click and choose **Import Package > Custom Package...**.
7. Locate the `.unitypackage` file you just downloaded and click **Open** to import it.

> ℹ️ **Note:** If you imported the `Inventory_WithDemo` package and want to remove the demo content, you can delete the `LordBreakerX/...` folder from your project's `Assets` directory.

## Option 2: Downloading the Full Project as a ZIP

1. From the root of the repository, click the green **Code** button.
2. Select **Download ZIP** from the dropdown menu.
3. Unzip the downloaded file.
4. You can now either:
   - Open Unity Hub and add the unzipped folder as a full Unity project.
   - Or, if you want to add the Inventory system to an existing Unity project, drag the `LordBreakerX` folder into your project's **Assets** folder or directly into the **Project** window in Unity.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This option includes the demo content by default, located at `LordBreakerX/...` folder from your project's `Assets` directory. If you prefer not to include the demo, you can simply delete this folder after importing.
